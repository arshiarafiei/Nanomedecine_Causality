# TXAS1-Biomarker-Analysis

This repository contains the Causal analysis code and data for the study titled "**Thromboxane-A Synthase 1 as a Potential Dual Biomarker for Metastatic Prostate Cancer and Atherosclerosis: Insights from a Nanomedicine Protein Corona, Machine Learning, and Actual Causality Approaches**.

## Requirements

Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Causal Analysis

To perform causal analysis for metastatic prostate cancer, execute the following command:

```bash
python mpc.py
```
To perform causal analysis for Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, execute the following command:

```bash
python ASCVD.py
```


## Data Access

The preprocessed data is available in the `data_supp.csv` file. The original dataset used in this study includes proteomic information from 35 plasma samples.
